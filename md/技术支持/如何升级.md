# How to update to the latest release

The following shows you how to update to the latest release of Visual Studio Code.

>**Note:** For Mac and Windows users, we have enabled the auto-update channel. If you're prompted by VS Code, accept the newest update and it will get installed (you won't need to do anything else to get the latest bits). If you'd rather control VS Code updates manually, see [How do I opt out of auto-updates](/docs/supporting/faq.md#how-do-i-opt-out-of-vs-code-autoupdates).

Auto-updates are not supported for Linux.

## Updating on Linux

* Download the VS Code zip file: [64-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534108) or [32-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615206).
* Open the zip and run **Code**

## Updating on OS X

You need to do this only if auto-update did not complete.

* Download the VS Code zip file from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534106).
* Open the zip file and drag **Code** over to **Applications**.
* Launch **Code**.

## Updating on Windows

You need to do this only if auto-update did not complete.

**Important:** Close any running instances of VS Code before attempting to update (to avoid VS Code not being able to start after you update).

* Run the installer from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534107).
* If you have trouble with the Windows installer, download the VS Code zip file from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615207).
